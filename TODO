P0:
    - Allow user to customize calculation settings via a front end
    - Add README.md

P1:
    - SWITCH OVER to using Google Calendar API, alleviate a lot of hacks
      dependent on front end, e.g.
        - Handle events with duration <= 40 min (only start time displays, so
          for now we're assuming they have duration 30 min)
    - Recompute on change more elegantly (right now just every 500ms)

P2:
    - Blinking red when above a certain threshold
    - Stricter validation of times (right now just checks for 2 digits for
      hours and minutes; should restrict to < 24, < 60)
    - Support month view
    - Handle overnight events (right now just upper bound end time at midnight)

P3:
    - Add border or something to indicate current day better, since background
      color change obscures the darker background which normally indicates it
    - Accomodate non-military time
